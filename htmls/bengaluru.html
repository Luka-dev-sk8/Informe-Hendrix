        <p>Bengaluru is one of the fastest-growing cities in India, 
            and it is currently facing severe environmental challenges 
            due to its vertiginous urban growth and the increasing demand 
            of water resources. The case of lake Bellandur 
            is alarming: in the words of the 
            NASA, "one of the city's lakes is so polluted 
            with sewage, trash, and industrial chemicals that 
            it has an alarming habit of catching on fire" and 
            in a recent incident "fire broke out on Bellandur 
            Lake and burned for seven hours" (Voiland, 2018). 
            Additionally, the polluting foam "has, at times, 
            spilled from the lake and covered surrounding streets, 
            cars, and bridges", showing its drastic impact on 
            city life.

        <p>To resolve these concerns, the NASA emphasizes satellite observation: "Sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) collect each day's imagery and data of water bodies around the globe that can be used to track the count and extent of lakes and reservoirs" (Voiland, 2018). Along with field sampling, this data allows for early warning systems and guides urban planning toward sustainable solutions, integrating ecological urbanism and renewable energy to protect Bengaluru’s water resources and improve the quality of life for its residents.</p>
