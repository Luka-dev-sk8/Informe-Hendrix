        <p>In Bengaluru, the areas most affected by pollution are located near textile factories, landfills, and industrial sites, while air pollution spreads throughout the city if not properly controlled. This is compounded by water scarcity, flooding caused by inadequate drainage, and a lack of effective environmental policies, all of which degrade quality of life. Residents can help by sorting and recycling waste, reducing the use of disposable plastics, and participating in cleanup and reforestation campaigns.</p>

        <p>The NASA Earth Observatory graphics demonstrate that environmental recovery is possible with proper planning and technology: the satellite image of Nepal shows a “visible expansion of forest area between 1992 and 2016” (NASA, 2022), while the comparative map of China and India shows an “increase in terrestrial greenness driven by reforestation and agriculture” (NASA, 2019). These examples support the potential of satellite monitoring to guide effective environmental policies and build a cleaner, more resilient future for Bengaluru.</p>

        <p>The government, in turn, should promote renewable energy, invest in recycling plants, and protect forests and natural reserves. Additionally, it is necessary to advance sustainable construction with energy-efficient housing, green roofs, and rainwater harvesting systems. Implementing a predictive model based on digital twins and NASA satellite data on urban expansion, pollution, and energy consumption would allow for anticipating future scenarios and guiding decisions toward more sustainable development.</p>
