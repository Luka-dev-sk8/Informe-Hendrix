        <p>In Bengaluru, the areas most affected by pollution are located near textile factories, landfills, and industrial sites, while air pollution spreads throughout the city uncontrolled. This issue is accompanied by water scarcity, flooding caused by inadequate drainage, and a lack of effective environmental policies, all of which degrade quality of life for the residents of the city. Locals can help improve this situation by sorting and recycling waste, reducing the use of disposable plastics, and participating in cleanup and reforestation campaigns.</p>

        <p>The NASA Earth Observatory graphics demonstrate that environmental recovery is possible with proper planning and technology: the satellite image of Nepal shows a “visible expansion of forest area between 1992 and 2016” (NASA, 2022), while the comparative map of China and India shows an “increase in terrestrial greenness driven by reforestation and agriculture” (NASA, 2019). These examples support the potential of satellite monitoring to guide effective environmental policies and build a cleaner, more resilient future for Bengaluru.</p>

        <p>The government, in turn, could promote renewable energy, invest in recycling plants, and protect forests and natural reserves. Additionally, it is necessary to advance sustainable construction with energy-efficient housing, green roofs, and rainwater harvesting systems. Implementing a predictive model based on digital twins and NASA satellite data on urban expansion, pollution, and energy consumption would allow the anticipation future scenarios and guiding decisions toward more sustainable development.</p>

            Linking Population Growth, Climate Conditions, 
            and Sustainable Development</h2>
        <img id="cuadro" src="../imagenes/grafico.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This analysis is based on official population statistics, meteorological records, and urban development studies from the NASA POWER API and WorldPop. Environmental indicators such as temperature, precipitation, and UV index were used alongside population data to calculate the Urban Impact Index, highlighting the effects of rapid urban growth in Bengaluru.</p>
